    Project Bookmark This project required me to build a fully responsive
    landing page to the designs provided. I used HTML5, along with CSS Grid and
    JavaScript for the areas that required interactivity, such as the features
    section. View Project Insure This was a small project which mostly consisted
    of HTML and CSS. I built a fully-responsive landing page. The only
    JavaScript this project required was to enable the toggling of the mobile
    navigation. View Project Fylo This project was built in pure HTML and CSS. I
    had mobile and desktop designs to work to and built it so that it was
    fully-responsive. I took a mobile-first approach and used modern CSS like
    Flexbox and Grid for layout purposes. View Project Interested in doing a
